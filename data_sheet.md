# Datasheet: Customer Churn Prediction Dataset

## Motivation

- The dataset was created for the purpose of predicting customer churn in a telecommunications company.
- While the exact creator is not specified, it appears to be a dataset commonly used in data science education and Kaggle competitions. The funding source is unknown.

## Composition

- The instances represent individual customers of a telecom company.
- The dataset contains approximately 3,333 instances in the training set, with an additional separate test set.
- The data includes various features about customers such as account information, usage patterns, and customer service interactions.
- There doesn't appear to be missing data in the provided dataset.
- The dataset may contain information that could be considered confidential, such as customer account details and usage patterns. However, it's likely that the data has been anonymized for public use.

## Collection process

- The exact data acquisition method is not specified, but it's likely to have been collected from the telecom company's customer database.
- The dataset appears to be a sample of the company's overall customer base, but the specific sampling strategy is not provided.
- The time frame of data collection is not specified in the available information.

## Preprocessing/cleaning/labelling

- The data appears to have undergone some preprocessing:
  - Numerical features have been scaled (as evident from our use of StandardScaler in the code).
  - The target variable 'Churn' has been encoded as a binary value.
- It's unclear if the raw data was saved in addition to the preprocessed data.

## Uses

- Beyond predicting customer churn, this dataset could potentially be used for:
  - Customer segmentation
  - Analyzing factors that contribute to customer satisfaction
  - Predicting customer lifetime value
- Users of this dataset should be aware that:
  - The data might not be representative of all telecom companies or customer bases.
  - There could be potential biases in the data collection or sampling process that aren't immediately apparent.
  - Using this data to make decisions about individual customers could lead to privacy concerns or unfair treatment.
- To mitigate risks, users should:
  - Anonymize any results or insights derived from the data
  - Be cautious about generalizing findings to other contexts or populations
  - Consider the ethical implications of any models or decisions based on this data
- The dataset should not be used for any purpose that could directly impact or identify individual customers represented in the data.

## Distribution

- The dataset has been distributed through data science education platforms and possibly through Kaggle.
- The specific copyright or IP license is not clear from the available information.

## Maintenance

- The maintainer of the dataset is not specified. It's likely that the dataset is static and not actively maintained or updated.
